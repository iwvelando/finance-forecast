# Test Fix Summary

## âœ… **Fixed Unused Variable Issue**

The issue was in the `TestCSVOutputFormat` function where the `results` variable was declared but not used after the `forecast.GetForecast()` call. 

**Fixed by**: Changing `results, err := forecast.GetForecast(...)` to `_, err := forecast.GetForecast(...)` since the results weren't actually needed for the CSV format test.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Test Status**

- âœ… **Config Package**: All tests passing
- âœ… **Forecast Package**: All tests passing  
- âœ… **Integration Tests**: Build error fixed

## ðŸ“Š **Test Suite Completeness**

The comprehensive test suite now includes:

1. **Configuration Tests** (`config/`)
   - Configuration loading and parsing
   - Date list formation and validation
   - Loan processing and amortization
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Mathematical validation

2. **Forecast Tests** (`forecast/`)
   - Event handling
   - Loan processing
   - Forecast generation
   - Multiple scenarios

3. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end application testing
   - Baseline validation
   - Output format verification
   - Complex scenario handling

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Benchmarking
   - Performance regression detection

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Refactoring**

The test suite is now ready to support safe refactoring:
- All tests compile and run successfully
- Comprehensive coverage of core functionality
- Baseline validation for output accuracy
- Edge case protection
- Performance monitoring

You can confidently proceed with refactoring knowing that any breaking changes will be caught by the test suite.
