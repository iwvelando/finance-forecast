# Single-loan configuration with a well-known amortization schedule
# Verification reference: standard loan amortization formula (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp)
# Monthly payment = (P × r) / (1 − (1+r)^−n) with P=10,000, r=0.06/12, n=12 ⇒ ≈ 860.66 per month (rounded to cents).
# Expected ending cash ≈ 20,000 − (12 × 860.66) = 9,672.03 after the December 2025 payoff.
