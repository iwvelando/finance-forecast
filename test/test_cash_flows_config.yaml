# Deterministic cash-flow configuration for integration tests
# startDate is one month before the first event so January 2025 runs first.
# Verification reference: cash flow arithmetic.
# See https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp
# Manual projection: 1,000 + (12 × 2,000) + (7 × 500) − (12 × 800)
# − (11 × 50) − (4 × 300) = 17,150.
